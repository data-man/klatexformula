KLatexFormula by Philippe Faist

Usage: klatexformula
           Opens klatexformula Graphical User Interface (GUI)
       klatexformula [OPTIONS]
           Performs actions required by [OPTIONS], and exits
       klatexformula --interactive|-I [OPTIONS]
           Opens the GUI and performs actions required by [OPTIONS]
       klatexformula filename1.klf|.klf.db [ filename2.klf|.klf.db ... ]
           Opens the GUI and imports the given library file(s) into the library.

       If additional filename arguments are passed to the command line, they are
       interpreted as library files to load into the library (only in interactive
       mode).

OPTIONS may be one or many of:
  -I|--interactive
      Runs KLatexFormula in interactive mode with a full-featured graphical user
      interface. This option is on by default, except if --input or --latexinput
      is given.
  -i|--input <file|->
      Specifies a file to read latex input from.
    -l|--latexinput <expr>
      Specifies the LaTeX code of an equation to render.
  -P|--paste-clipboard
  -S|--paste-selection
      Specifies that the LaTeX code should be pasted from the system clipboard or
      current mouse selection. Works only in interactive mode.
  -B|--base64arg
      Specifies that the argument to the option immediately following this one is
      encoded in base64. For example:
	klatexformula --base64arg --latexinput="YV4yK2JeMj1jXjI="
      will use the latex code "a^2+b^2=c^2"
      This option can be specified more than once on the command line, each time
      indicating that the argument to the immediately next option is encoded in
      base64.
      This option can be useful when scripting, to avoid the nuisance of having to
      escape latex code from the shell.
  -o|--output <file|->
      Specifies to write the output image (obtained from equation given by --input
      or --latexinput) to <file> or standard output.
  -F|--format <format>
      Specifies the format the output should be written in. By default, the format
      is guessed from file name extension and defaults to PNG.
  -f|--fgcolor <'#xxxxxx'>
      Specifies a color (in web #RRGGBB hex format) to use for foreground color.
      Don't forget to escape the '#' to prevent the shell from interpreting it as
      a comment.
  -b|--bgcolor <-|'#xxxxxx'>
      Specifies a color (in web #RRGGBB hex format, or '-' for transparent) to
      use as background color (defaults to transparent)
  -X|--dpi <N>
      Use N dots per inch (DPI) when converting latex output to image. Defaults to
      1200 (high-resolution image).
  -m|--mathmode <expression containing '...'>
      Specifies which LaTeX math mode to use, if any. The argument to this option
      is any string containing "...", which will be replaced by the equation
      itself. Defaults to "\[ ... \]"
  -p|--preamble <LaTeX code>
      Any LaTeX code that will be inserted before \begin{document}. Useful for
      including custom packages with \usepackage{...}.
  -q|--quiet
      Disable console output of warnings and errors.
  -d|--daemonize
      Run a separate, detached, klatexformula process and return immediately. All
      other options, like --latexinput, may still be given. They will be forwared
      to the daemon process.

  --outlinefonts [ <ON|Y[ES]|T[RUE]|1 or OFF|N[O]|F[ALSE]|0> ]
      Convert embedded fonts in EPS and PDF to vector outlines (gs with -dNOCACHE).
      Useful for exporting to eg. Adobe Illustrator.
  --lborderoffset <N>
  --tborderoffset <N>
  --rborderoffset <N>
  --bborderoffset <N>
      Include a margin of N postscript points on left, top, right, or bottom margin
      respectively.
  --tempdir </path/to/temp/dir>
      Specify the directory in which KLatexFormula will write temporary files.
      Defaults to a system-specific temporary directory like "/tmp/".
  --latex <latex executable>
  --dvips <dvips executable>
  --gs <gs executable>
  --epstopdf <epstopdf executable>
      Specifiy the executable for latex, dvips, gs or epstopdf. By default, they
      are searched for in $PATH and/or in common system directories.

  -h|--help
      Display this help text and exit.
  -V|--version
      Display KLatexFormula version information and exit.

  -Q|--qtoption <qt-option>
      Specify a Qt-Specific option. For example, to launch KLatexFormula in
      Plastique GUI style, use:
        klatexformula  --qtoption='-style=Plastique'
      Note that if <qt-option> begins with a '-', then it must be appended to the
      long '--qtoption=' syntax with the equal sign.


NOTES
  * When run in interactive mode, the newly evaluated equation is appended to
    KLatexFormula's history.
  * When not run in interactive mode, no X11 server is needed.
  * Additional translation files and/or data can be provided to klatexformula by specifying
    a list of Qt rcc files or directories containing such files to import in the KLF_RESOURCES
    environment variable. Separate the file names with ':' on unix/mac, or ';' on windows. The
    default paths can be included with an empty section ('::') or leading or trailing ':'.
  * Please report any bugs and malfunctions to the author.
