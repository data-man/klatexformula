KLatexFormula - README file

INSTALLATION

* To install KLatexFormula with graphical user interface under KDE (complete), then all you need to
do is run configure, make and make install, for example like this:
prompt> confgure
prompt> make
prompt> make install             OR             promt # make install    [as superuser]

* If you have KDE, but you would like to compile only the base library (klfbackend), you can run
prompt> configure --disable-klatexformula
instead of 'configure' [TODO]

* If you only have Qt and you would like to compile only the base library (klfbackend), you can use the
Qt project file in the src/klfbackend directory:
prompt> cd src/klfbackend/
prompt/src/klfbackend> qmake
prompt/src/klfbackend> make
prompt/src/klfbackend> make install
[TODO]
