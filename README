DESCRIPTION

This KDE application is especially designed for generating an image
(e.g. PNG) from a LaTeX equation, this using a nice GUI. Support for
Copy-Paste, Save as image/pdf/ps and drag-and-drop is included. In
addition to supporting a whole GUI-based user interface, this package
includes the library KLFBackend to integrate KLatexFormula functionality
into your programs.


INSTALLATION

* To install KLatexFormula with graphical user interface under KDE (complete), then all you need to
do is run configure, make and make install, for example like this:
prompt> confgure
prompt> make
promt # make install    -- you may need to be root

* If you have KDE, but you would like to compile only the base library (klfbackend), you can run
prompt> configure --disable-klatexformula
instead of 'configure'. Then 'make' and 'make install' as usual.

* If you only have Qt and you would like to compile only the base library (klfbackend), you can use the
Qt project file in the src/klfbackend directory:
prompt> cd src/klfbackend/
prompt/src/klfbackend> vi klfbackend.pro    [or your favorite editor] -- set the first variables of the file correctly
prompt/src/klfbackend> qmake
prompt/src/klfbackend> make
prompt/src/klfbackend # make install         -- you may need to be root
